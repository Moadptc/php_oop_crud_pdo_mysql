PHP CRUD tutorial with PDO extension and MySQL
## Description
The PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension defines a consistent, lightweight interface for accessing databases in PHP. PDO extension provides a data-access abstraction layer, which means that you can use different databases using the same functions to queries and fetch data from the database.

This PHP PDO example, implements a simple PHP CRUD operation, learning PDO connection, PDO insert, PDO select, PDO update, PDO delete query management. The example provides a simple Web view, add, edit, and delete functionality with PHP OOP using PDO MySQL.

In this example script, we’ll fetch the users data from the database and display the user data list with add link, edit link, and delete link. By these links user can add new data to the database, update previously inserted data and delete the data from the database. We’ll use Object oriented approach to building the example script and bootstrap table structure for styling the list, form fields, and links.
